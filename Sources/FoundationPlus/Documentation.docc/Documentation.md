# ``FoundationPlus``

This package extends the Swift Foundation framework with extensions to existing types and (in future) entirely new types.

## Overview

``FoundationPlus`` acts as a pool of extensions and new types to the Swift Foundation Framework. It doesn't follow any specific order or plans as it just a collection of things I found useful when working with Swift and Foundation.
	Neverheless it is tested and should work as the documentation suggests.

### String

- ``Swift/String/dateFormat``
- ``Swift/String/levenshteinDistance(to:)``

### StringProtocol

- ``Swift/StringProtocol/subscript(index:)``

### CaseIterable
